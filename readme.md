## Laravel 5.8 Boilerplate

This is my own version of this boilerplate, with added features like catalan language, as well as other packages I use to build a project with laravel.

Refer to the [original repository](https://github.com/rappasoft/laravel-5-boilerplate) for any documentation and demo.
